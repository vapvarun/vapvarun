## 🚀 Current Focus: The AI Coding Revolution

I'm currently deep in the trenches of **AI-powered development workflows**, experimenting with:

- 🤖 **Claude MCP (Model Context Protocol)** — Building custom servers and exploring agentic coding patterns
- 🧪 **Generative AI Tools** — Testing LLM-assisted coding, automated testing, and intelligent code review systems
- 🔬 **Offline AI Development** — Creating local AI assistants for WordPress plugin analysis without cloud dependencies
- ⚡ **AI + WordPress** — Bridging traditional WordPress development with modern AI capabilities
- 📊 **Automated QA** — Leveraging AI for smarter, faster, and more scalable testing in WordPress projects

**Why this matters:** I believe AI won't replace developers—it'll amplify what we can build. I'm documenting the journey, sharing learnings, and building tools that merge 13+ years of WordPress expertise with cutting-edge AI workflows.

## 💡 Philosophy & Approach

**On Development:**
> "Code should be elegant, maintainable, and solve real problems. I believe in writing clean, documented code that the next developer (including future me) will thank you for."

**On AI in Development:**
> "AI won't replace developers—it'll separate those who adapt from those who don't. I'm betting on the future where humans and AI collaborate to build impossible things."

**On Open Source:**
> "The WordPress community gave me everything. Contributing back isn't optional—it's how we keep the ecosystem thriving for the next generation."

**On Community Building:**
> "Great communities aren't built with technology alone. They're built with empathy, thoughtful design, and understanding human connection."
